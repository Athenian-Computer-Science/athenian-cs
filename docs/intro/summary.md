# Summary 

Welcome to Computer Science! 

This course serves as a continuation of the Computational Thinking/Computer Science series, while
also being an entry point to CS for those who did not take CT in the 9 th grade. It is a project-based
course that allows students at any level to expand their skills. The course began with a quick
introduction to Python basics, including variables, general syntax and error messages. From there,
we explored different flow control methods before starting our first major project. The experience
for an end-user has been emphasized, and programs are structured to give appropriate instructions
to the user and be able to handle invalid input. Practice takes a variety of forms, including reading
programs and predicting the output, Parsons Puzzles, writing programs to meet predefined tests
and open-ended programs that provide more freedom. The projects ask students to apply their
skills in different ways. Students completed a TicTacToe game and two projects of their choice this
semester. Grades are based on skill demonstration and projects, which are assessed using an E-S-R-
N rubric (Excellent, Satisfactory, Revise, Not Assessable); projects earning an R or N require
revision and projects earning an S may be revised if desired.
